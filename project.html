		        <h4>Interaction+: Interaction Enhancement of Visualizations on Web </h4>
		        <p>Nowdays, there are more and more visualizations emerging on the web. Some of them lack sufficient interactions, even not interactive at all. This project is intended to provide casual users with powerful interactions for existing visualizations without programming, to support a true discourse with the visualizations. <br>

		        <h4>Single Route Travel Behaviour Analysis</h4>
		        <p> Different routes have different traffic conditions. Even the same route, its traffic condition changes over time. In this project, I focus on studying the travel behaviour of a single route, to have insignt into the travel behaviour of a single route, e.g. which road segments play the significant role in the time cost, when the route is the most crowded etc.

		        <h4>Multiple Route Choice Behaviour Analysis</h4>
		        <p> Drivers make route choice everyday. This project studies the factors that influence drivers' route choice decision. Potential factors are extracted from general GPS trajectory dataset, such as travelling distance of each routes, route significance, departing time etc. The factors' impacts are visually studied as well as mathmetically evaluated.

		        <h4>OD Patterns Analysis of A Region</h4>
		        <p> 
		        	In this project, I study the Origin and Destination, i.e. OD patterns of a region based on the taxi trajectories in a city. 
		        	Given a region of interest, its hot travelling origins and destinations are detected and visualized, the dynamic traffic patterns are explored.

		        <h4>Study of Traffic Jam Propagation among Road Segments</h4>
		        <p> 
		        	Traffic congestion is an urban issue which millions of people come across everyday. Understanding how the traffic congestion propagate is essential in transportation field. Based on taxi GPS trajectories, this project studies the variation of traffic conditions for each road, and the propagation of traffic jams along the road network.
